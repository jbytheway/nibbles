The nibbles sounds are derived from the originals in the form of QBasic PLAY
commands, thus:

Intro:
PLAY "MBT160O1L8CDEDCDL4ECC"

Level start:
PLAY "T160O1>L20CDEDCDL10ECC"

Eat number:
PLAY "MBO0L16>CCCE"

Death:
PLAY "MBO0L32EFGEFDC"

These are rewritten using the Lilypond files in this directory.
