This project uses makeshift to build.  If the makeshift directory is empty then
you probably need to run

$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

Next you will need some dependencies:

- gcc >= 4.4 (this code uses recently added C++0x features so new gcc really is
  needed; other compilers are unikely to cope in the near term)
- boost of some relatively recent version
- portaudio
- libsndfile
- optimal, my options parsing library.  Read about it at
  http://github.com/jbytheway/optimal or clone it from
  git@github.com:jbytheway/optimal.git
- cagoul, an OpenGL library I've worked on.  Read about it at
  http://github.com/jbytheway/cagoul or clone it from
  git@github.com:jbytheway/cagoul.git
- gtkglextmm (the GTK OpenGL interface library, and its GTK dependencies)
- FTGL (An OpenGL font library)

You may need to add some things to user.mk, e.g. to get the right g++ version
or allow it to find optimal if you don't install it (which you shouldn't need
to.  Here for example is my user.mk:

  CXX = g++-4.4.5
  BUILD_CPPFLAGS += \
    -I$(top_srcdir)../optimal \
    -I$(top_srcdir)../cagoul
  BUILD_LDFLAGS += \
    -L$(top_srcdir)../optimal/optimal \
    -L$(top_srcdir)../cagoul/cagoul

See makeshift/INSTALL for details of what goes in user.mk.

Then to get a debug version it should be simply

$ make

Parallel build should work fine (with make's -j option) and is advisable on a
multi-core machine.

The server can be run with

$ ./bin/server/nibbles-server

and the client with

$ ./bin/gtk/nibbles-gtk
